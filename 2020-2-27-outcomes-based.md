 INTRODUCTION

Examinations predominantly use question papers as a vital constituent to discover the
caliber of students. A good exam gives all students an equal opportunity to fully
demonstrate their learning. The National Board of Accreditation(NBA),India [12]states that
Autonomous institutes should encourage the standard of teaching, self-analysis and
responsibility in higher education and promote the Institutions in perceive their educational
aim, embrace education exercises that accredit them to yield appreciative quality
professionals and to aid them in ceaselessly bestowing to the area of education through
transformation & research. Assessment is one or more activity that recognizes, gather, and
construct data to assess the fulfillment of Course outcome and program Outcomes.
Automatic Question paper generator system considers question paper creation as its
fundamental activity, and the caliber of questions is the key in enhancing examination
standard, which depend on intelligent and random choice of a set of questions.

1. Course Outcome mapping:

Course outcomes are statements that describe significant and essential learning that learners
have achieved, and can reliably demonstrate at the end of a course or program .Mapping
of questions with the Course outcomes is one of the important challenges faced while
making Question paper. So Question paper validation is to be ensured to get desired
standard from outcome attainment perspective as well as learning levels perspective.

2. No repetition of questions

While making question paper many a times patterns or repetitions may occur. So to avoid
this situation the challenge faced is to make use of such algorithms which keep track of
questions and do not allow the repetition of questions.

3. Chapter wise allocation

As there are different types of exams like unit test and end semester exam, so each
exam has different modules of chapters covered on which the question paper has to be
generated. So challenge faced here is to make system such that it is able to allocate the
question chapter wise or module wise for the respective exams.

4. Analysis of database

In order to effectively assess the students, the important step is to plan the question paper
which covers all the vital components to test knowledge of student. One such taxonomy
was presented by Bloom (1956), who described degree of learning to be classified into sixunique domains, namely 
1.Knowledge 2.Comprehension 3.Application 4.Analysis
5.Synthesis 6. Evaluation, the benefit of making questions based on Bloom’s taxonomy
prepares to make the questions that help to evaluate learning ability of the students, to
achieve this thing we have to design our database according to Bloom’s taxonomy which
will cover all types of questions and challenge faced there is to segregate the questions in
the question bank database as per their types defined by the Bloom’s taxonomy.

5. Formatting of paper

The generated questions from the system are to be presented in proper format or proper
exam template. So the challenge So the challenge faced is how to format the layout of
the paper in the required style and in a compatible format.

6. Paper pattern

It is very important to know the question paper pattern and Marks allocation Scheme. So
while designing the question paper the challenge is that the system should give flexibility
in choosing the desired paper pattern and allocating marks to each question in paper

LITERATURE REVIEW

The outcome of coaching and education can be attained by performing evaluation to
compute student’s intellectual levels and therefore the written exam is a method for
teachers to validate student understanding and knowledge, as well as, to evaluate the
degree to which students are able to adjust a learning thesis in a given environment.
Evaluation through written examination is a conventional procedure but it is a universal
test technique performed in almost of the educational colleges present day. Therefore, the
question must be catering in following with the subject contents learned by students to
attain learning outcomes. However, the technique of questions writing is very demanding
task for the teacher. The state is getting more challenging when teacher try to compose
fair quality and fair questions to evaluate diverse level of intellectual. In 2006, Ittizar
Aldabe etal [1]made an attempt to create automatic questions called Arik Iturri, the
procedure was based on Corpora and NLP methods, and the information source for the
system was the linguistically inspected real corpora, depicted in XML mark-up language.
The benefit of the system was its capacity to exclude the ill developed questions. In 2006,
Li -Chun Sung etal [2] presented a outline for Automatic Quiz Generation for worldwide
English E-learning System from a given English text to evaluate learner. This was built on
quiz creation system for understanding of text content. The question generator takes the
pure semantic network and the information base of Word Net and Google to create
questions for quizIn 2010, Ming Liu et al[3]presented automatic question generation for
literature review writing support. He took the literature review as input word and then the
selected syntactic and semantic characteristic of words were used for question generation,
which were based on a specification question bank consisting of equal match pattern and
question templates. Another close work done by them was G-ASKS, where the similar
method was used for academic writing to create questions built on Graesser & Person
taxonomy, here the Citation Classification was finished with the aid of Naive Bayes
Classifier.

    OBJECTIVES

1.Generates the Question Paper in a matter of seconds.
2.Reduce the staff efforts.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

Hardware Specification
CPU Speed: 2GHz recommended or higher
Processor: Pentium Processor or above
Memory/RAM: 1GB minimum,2GB recommended or higher
Size of Hard Disk:60 GB minimum

Software Specification
Framework: Django
Operating System: Ubuntu 18.4

The best Django packages:

1. sentry-sdk

This is a must-have tool for any Django project as it’s key that we stay informed about all the
code-based issues in the application.
2. django rest framework

If you want to write a REST Architectural Constraints API, this package will do that for you –
together with proper, auto-generated documentation that supports implementing the package in
projects.
3. django-extensions
A set of tools that help with your daily work.

4.django-rest-framework-jwt
While using DRF for some projects, it’s essential to add some JWT token authorization. That’s
exactly what this package is about.

5. django-rest-swagger
The DRF offers auto-generated documentation – and this package makes the documentation nicer
for your projects.

6. easy-thumbnails
Any web service that allows uploading and viewing photos needs the thumbnails feature. This
package provides it.7. django-simple-history
This package keeps a history of record changes. If a client has access to the database
through the admin panel, they might change something by mistake or may want to return
to the previous version of the text.

8.django-adminactions

A simple data export to known file types like CSV or XLS. You can also export data as
a fixture to the test server, and this fixture can contain Foreign Keys. The package allows
generating graphs in the admin panel as well.

Modules in Outcomes based Education System:
1. Login module
2. Administrator module
3. User module
4. Subject module
5. Exam type selection module
6. Paper pattern module
7. Priority assignment module
